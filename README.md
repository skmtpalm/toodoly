I am still new to rails and web application development beginner. So, the curriculum written in step by step like this is very useful! I do not have a mentor, though. (I live in a region called Shizuoka prefecture in Japan) Become someone a mentor! ! It is difficult to create an app by writing code yourself after rails tutorial. But it is fun to pursue based on such materials!
